TimeMe is a small python pacakge to time the execution of functions and methods and help you manage
your experiments involving measuring runtime of code


The goal of TimeMe is to make it easier for you to time/profile your code without writing repetitive code to record times, manage the results of these time/profile experiments in a single place, and make it easy to compare the execution of functions and methods.
